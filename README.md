## About me

I'm ender443, my passions include anything to do with video games (playing, making, ect.), creating things no matter the media, and writing my own stories. Safe to it's anything that allows me to be creative without any restraints. However video games aren't my only passions, I'm an artist. I use media's like traditional pen and paper, and digital with a drawing tablet. I am also a musician playing in various bands and styles, though my main styles are classical and jazz. I plan on using my music knowledge to write the music for the future video games that I make.

## Love for Gaming

My love for video games started when I was younger, playing "Sonic" on the Sega Genesis, and only grew from that moment on. I have had ideas for future video games that no one has created and there is where the idea of me becoming a game developer started. More video games released as I grew, leading to me having all time favorites games such as "Minecraft", "Splatoon 3", and "Subnautica" just to name a few. My first experience with code was through Code.org, with my knowledge further growing through classes that taught Python, C, and JavaScript. I only hope for my knowledge of coding and game development to further improve as I grow and learn.
